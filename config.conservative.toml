# Polymarket LP Bot — Conservative Configuration
#
# USE THIS FOR YOUR FIRST DEPLOYMENT.
#
# Philosophy: survive and learn. Wide spreads, small sizes, few markets.
# You'll earn fewer rewards but you won't blow up while learning the dynamics.
#
# Once you've run for 1-2 weeks and understand the PnL breakdown
# (spread capture vs rewards vs adverse selection), start tightening.
#
# Tuning path:
#   1. Start here (week 1-2): learn, monitor, check daily
#   2. Tighten offset to 1.5¢, increase size to 300 (week 3-4)
#   3. Add more markets (5-8), increase capital to $1000 (month 2)
#   4. Move to config.example.toml defaults if everything looks good

# WHAT THIS CONFIG DOES:
#
# • Deploys $500 across 3 markets (~$166 each, capped at $200)
# • Posts 1 bid + 1 ask per token, 200 shares each
# • Quotes 2¢ from midpoint (wider = safer, less reward)
# • Requotes every 15 seconds or on 0.3¢ midpoint shift
# • Skews aggressively to shed inventory
# • Avoids markets resolving within 14 days
# • Kills everything at $50 total loss or $25 per-market loss
#
# EXPECTED RESULTS (rough):
# • Reward income: $2-8/day (depends on market competition)
# • Spread capture: ~$0-2/day (wide spread = fewer fills)
# • Risk: max $50 loss before kill switch fires
# • Break-even: ~1-2 weeks to cover setup time
#
# WHAT TO WATCH:
# • Trading PnL (spread captures - adverse selection losses)
# • If trading PnL is consistently negative, widen offset more
# • If rewards >> trading losses, you're profitable — start tightening
# • Inventory buildup — if one side keeps growing, that market may
#   have informed traders. Consider removing it.
